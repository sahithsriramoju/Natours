# Natours
Natours is a Sitefinity application. I have created this application just for the purpose of learning.

The application features are: 
Widgets to display static content and images by using sf-image-selector and sf-html-field-selector.
Dynamic module called tours which has images and various information regarding different tours.
Widget to display the selected three Tour dynamic content items by using sf-dynamic-items-selector.

Note: The UI designs were created by @jonasschmedtmann as part of his Udemy course. He gave his consent to all his udemy course takers to use his course UI design for there projects. So all the UI credit goes to @jonasschmedtmann :)
